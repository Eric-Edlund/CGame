Small tile vars:
- Finite space
- Surface vegitation
- Soil Quality
- Soil content (clay, sand)
- Core sample (stone, ores)

How collection work?
    All processes need a building.

    Phases in each turn:
    1. Extraction: Labor -> Material
        The building interface considers how much labor can be taken and how much material it will produce.

    2. Transport:
        Materials have to be stored in buildings. A generative building can only make more if it has space.

    3. Construction: Labor + Material -> Structure
        Buildings need to be built in a tile with space.

Economic Building Blocks:
- Structures (buildings)
- Transport (just people at first)
- Commodities (labor, food)
- People (with wants, needs and tax money)


Companies and private ownership?
Micro vs Macro economics?
We will simulate:
- Individual people

Types of labor
Types of storage

Transport Vars:
- Weight
- Volume
Density: in volume/weight (1)

Transportation:
- Transport Infrustructure (Roads, Canals, Tracks)
- Transport Entities (Cars, Boats, Trains)
    Need a space to end up being (Parking lots)
    Require input to run (gas, labor)
    Have a capacity (volume, weight, fluid/solid)
    Require maintenence
    Must be build
    Are path finding entities
    Use bandwidth

Every car adds to the total road network's bandwidth (Total weight, volume and time)
Efficiency of a road segment is a product of the road and the average operation cost of all the cars
Cost to transport x goods:
    1. Find x as a proportion of the badwidth
    2. Charge that proportion of total fleet maintenence + operation
